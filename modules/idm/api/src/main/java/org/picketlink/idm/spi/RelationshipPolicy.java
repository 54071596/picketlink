/**
 * The relationship policy determines how and where relationships between identities are stored.
 *
 * There is a one-to-one relationship between an IdentityConfiguration and RelationshipPolicy, i.e. each
 * IdentityConfiguration has its own RelationshipPolicy.
 *
 * The RelationshipPolicy defines the relationship types that are managed by the IdentityConfiguration itself for 
 * "self-contained" relationships, i.e. relationships for which all participating identities belong to a partition
 * governed by that IdentityConfiguration.  It also defines the "global" (i.e. relationships between identities
 * belonging to different partitions/configurations) relationship types that the IdentityConfiguration 
 * is capable of supporting.
 *
 * It is the responsibility of the developer to ensure that multiple RelationshipPolicy configurations do not provide
 * overlapping support for the same global relationship types.  If multiple IdentityConfiguration instances have been
 * configured and their relationship policies provide overlapping support, the behaviour is undefined.
