  <section>
    <title>Overview</title>

    <para>
      Quickstarts are self-contained, concise examples that generally demonstrate at most one or two features. The
      PicketLink
      quickstarts at GitHub provide working, buildable code that shows the usage of a number of authentication,
      authorization and
      identity management features. They are a nice way to communicate the design, common and best practices and the usage
      of PicketLink.
    </para>

    <para>
      The PicketLink Quickstarts are part of the JBoss Developer Framework(<ulink
            url="http://www.jboss.org/jdf/quickstarts/get-started/">
      http://www.jboss.org/jdf/quickstarts/get-started/</ulink>), formerly known as JDF.
      There you can find a lot of useful stuff about Java, JavaEE and of course all JBoss projects and products.
      Also, there are a lot of useful information and tutorials that will guide you to configure and prepare your
      environment to start using any of the available quickstarts.
    </para>

    <para>
      All quickstarts are available at GitHub. So you can download them, fork the repository (if you have an GitHub
      account, of course)
      or even just clone the repository. The latter option is fully described along the README.md file for each quickstart, as
      well as a lot of additional information, configuration requirements, how to deploy and undeploy using the JBoss Enterprise
      Application Platform 6(and beyond) and so forth.

      PicketLink can be used to solve the most simple as well some of the most advanced security use cases. The main objective
      of the quickstarts is to cover most of use cases as we can, so people can quickly understand and start solving their own
      security-related problems based on what we're offering.
